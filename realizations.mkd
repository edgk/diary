* Patriarchy in itself does not mean that all men are surpressing women, only that the majority of people in power are men.
* Strategies used to stabilize the current system:
  * *Divide and conquer*: men vs. women, black vs. white, rich vs. poor, hetero vs. everybody else.
  * *The illusion of freedom*. Giving people the feeling to be informed and making rational decisions while in reality they follow the deliberately implemented cultural programming which is intended to *divide* them. This allows the system to continue because in order to change the system, people need to *collaborate*.
